# MazeSolver

This project is a Java GUI containing tools needed to construct a maze on a grid. Users can set the size of the maze and add start/end points and walls.
To solve the maze, we've implemented the breadth-first search algorithm, which finds the shortest path through any valid maze that the user creates.
